# Apache Arrow examples
The purpose of this project is mainly to practice using Apache Arrow for cpp 
(https://arrow.apache.org/). For me personally, this is not a trivial task. 
Along the way, the idea arose to compare the performance of the different 
libraries, in particular Pandas, Polars and Pyarrow.

Some materials from the book â€œPandas Workout 200 exercises that will make you 
a stronger data analyst" by Reuven M. Lerner (https://github.com/reuven/pandas-workout) were used for practical tasks. 

Mainly here you can find practical examples for Arrow in addition to those on 
the official website and repository https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/main/cpp/examples

For simplicity, examples for C++ are located in header files, and for Python - in Jupyter Notebooks.
For cpp you need to select the corresponding part in main: Chapter_name_Part_Number (for example group_joining_part_2)

### To run cpp part:
```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
./arrow
```
